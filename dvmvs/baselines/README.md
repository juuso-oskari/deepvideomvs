### Four Baseline Methods Compared with DeepVideoMVS

Modified inference codes for four existing methods that we compare our method with.

We also provide finetuned (by us, on our ScanNet training split) weights for GP-MVS, MVDepthNet and DPSNet. 
DELTAS is originally trained on ScanNet, so we do not finetune it.

Original weights and the full code for these models can be found in their respective repositories.
